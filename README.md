# Recommendation-System-w-Cosine-Sim.

Cosine similarity is a measure of similarity between two non-zero vectors of an inner product space. It is calculated as the cosine of the angle between the two vectors. The cosine similarity is particularly used in high-dimensional positive spaces where the magnitude of the vectors does not matter.

The formula for cosine similarity between two vectors A and B is:
cosine¬†similarity= cos(Œ∏) = A‚ãÖB / ‚à•A‚à•‚à•B‚à•

‚Äã
Where:

ùê¥
‚ãÖ
ùêµ
is the dot product of vectors A and B.

‚à•
ùê¥
‚à•
and 
‚à•
ùêµ
‚à•
are the magnitudes of vectors A and B, respectively.
‚Äã

The workflow is;

Preprocessing: Clean and tokenize the text data (anime synopses).

Vectorization: Convert the cleaned text into numerical vectors using CountVectorizer.

Similarity Calculation: Compute the pairwise cosine similarity between the vectors representing the synopses.


# Consider two synopses:

Synopsis A: "Death Note is a psychological thriller"

Synopsis B: "A psychological thriller about Death Note"

After vectorization, the document-term matrix might look something like this (simplified example):

Then, the cosine similarity between these vectors would be calculated. If they are very similar, the cosine similarity value will be close to 1.
